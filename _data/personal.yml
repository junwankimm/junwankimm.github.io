intro:
  title: Career Summary
  body: >
    _**Human can think beyond a single modality**_, such as seeing a scene (visual representations) and 
    conjuring up poems (language representations) about it, or imagining the sounds (audio representations) 
    associated with that scene, or so on.

    <br/><br/>In this context, I believe that imitating humans through integration of such modalities is  
    ultimately the direction AI should pursue. Therefore, _**my primary research lie in the field of artificial intelligence,  
    particularly but not limited to computer vision and multimodal. Specifically, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Multimodal-Large-Language Models (MLLMs)**_
