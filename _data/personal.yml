    Currently, I am an undergraduate student majoring in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Yonsei University.
    My research interest lies in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly but not limited to high-dimensional computer vision perception.
    I am searching for MS/Ph.D. programs abroad that aligns with my research interests and career goals.
